Importance and Uses of:

Readme - 
This provides contributors an idea about the purpose of the project. It can also contain isntructions such as how to build a project and what tools/dependencies are required to build a project or instructions as to how to submit new features or changes to a project and rules relating to that.

gitignore - 
It contains a list files, directories or subdirectories that are excluded from being synced to the git repository.
For example build and cache files are generated on each person's systems and should not be synced to the repo and hence, these can be added to the '.gitignore' file at the root of the repository.
